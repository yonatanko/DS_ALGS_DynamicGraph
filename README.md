This project focuses on the implementation and manipulation of dynamic graphs using Java. It involves creating classes representing graph nodes, edges, and trees, implementing algorithms for adding/removing elements, and performing graph searches. The goal is to demonstrate an understanding of graph theory and its application in programming. The repository contains a src folder with all the Java files for the classes and algorithms and instructions pdf file.
